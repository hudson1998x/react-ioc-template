#### Rapid frontend development
Writing tonnes of frontend boilerplate is tedious, catchy pesky null references, map all your entities and endpoints to async TypeScript or JavaScript functions and types.

```bash
# --sourceType either 'ts' or 'js'
php cli.php @build/generate-types --sourceType=ts --outputDir=frontend/api"
```

You can then reference these entities across all your react apps, with useful code completion too.
